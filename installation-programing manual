The SQL file needed to create the database in MySQL Workbench is included in the
folder titled “Database - Schema.” The file contains the code needed to create the tables as well
as the code that could be used to insert all the tuples in the database. Moreover, if needed, the
original csv files that include all the tuples that were imported into the workbench are stored in
the folder titled “Dataset”. To implement the database management system, one can simply copy
and paste the sql code in the sql file into their own connection on MySQL Workbench. These
codes include the ones under “Table structure for table ‘...’ ” and “Dumping Data for table ‘...’”.
There are 8 tables included.

To implement the command line user interface, one would first need to go to the
command prompt of their device and enter “pip install mysql-connector-python” so that python
would be able to access and make changes to the database in MySQL. The code for the user
interface is provided in two different forms: HTML files and Python File. However, the python
file will likely not work because the user would have to manually select which connection for
python to connect. Note that the password will also be different depending on the user’s password 
for the service on their device. Therefore, in order to implement the user interface, one could 
copy the python code from the HTML file into their choice of python integrated development 
environment, and then update the MySQL connection to where they implemented the database to, 
and finally export it as a python file. To run the interface, one would need to cd the exported
python file’s directory. And then call the file.
