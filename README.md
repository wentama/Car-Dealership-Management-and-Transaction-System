# Car-Dealership-Management-and-Transaction-System

  Car dealerships have an inventory of hundreds of cars with different models, make, year
of production, price, paint job, mileage, packages offered, and ownership status. The number of
cars available with each of the specified attributes will vary. Dealerships will be carrying cars
with the requested specifications and others wonâ€™t. For example, a car that is a Lexus IS 350,
made in 2021, is priced at $45,885, has a silver body, has below 10,000 miles, an F-sport
package, and is certified Pre-owned may be at a Lakewood Lexus dealership and not at a
Cleveland Lexus dealership. Therefore, keeping track of all this information will require a
Database Management System.

  There will be many customers looking to buy a car and each dealership will have
multiple employees trying to sell these cars to interested customers. Checking if the customer is
qualified to buy the car based on his or her credit score is important and also taking into account
the specifications of the customer will limit which car he or she is able to purchase and if it is
available at the local dealership. Additionally, if a customer purchases a car or already owns a
car, no other customers would be able to buy that car.

  This system will store the information of what cars are available at each dealership and
will check if the customer is qualified to buy a car that he or she is looking for and if that car is
available at the local dealership and dealerships nearby. Additionally, employee information will
also be stored to keep track of which dealership the employee is associated with, how much he or
she is getting paid, how many cars the employee has sold, and any transactions that happen
between the employee and the customer.
