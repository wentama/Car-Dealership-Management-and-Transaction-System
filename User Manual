User Manual 

This database is used to see an inventory of a dealership and whether a customer is able
to purchase a vehicle from the dealership. Also, it tracks the transaction between a customer and
an employee and sees if certain vehicles are available at a dealership for sale. When purchasing a
car, a customer can see its mileage, price, color, package and previous owner. The only thing a
customer needs to do is to enter a car’s information he or she is looking for. For example, if a
customer is looking for an Audi. What he needs to do is just enter the information such as color,
model, and the system will output a list of Audi cars with their own unique Car_id, packages and
prices. To get access to such a search engine, a customer needs to run the python file in their
computer’s cmd. When they enter the certain directory and run the python file, the cmd will give
you 7 options, you can not only search for your favorite cars’ information, but also search for the
previous owners, the customers' information, also with the transaction between employees and
customers. Once you enter a number of options you are looking for, all you need to enter is
simple, for example, you only need to enter your own SSN, or a car’s year, mileage or price, you
can get the information about the seller, the buyer and the car itself. If you need to add a
transaction, all you need to do is to press 6, enter the date, cSSN, eSSN and the car_id, and then
you are done, and that certain record will be saved to the system. When you have finished your
research, all you need to do is to enter 7, and you can log out from this engine. This system will
provide you a safe, sound information package that will make you feel more safe about the car
you are going to purchase and the dealership you are dealing with.
